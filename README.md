# OpenPhysics

Inspired by the work of [@gazbd](https://twitter.com/gazbd) and [@Rosalindphys](https://twitter.com/Rosalindphys), I can see there are many advantages to producing new physics resources. I can also see that some tasks are well suited to programmatic generation. I think there is tremendous value in opening up the underlying code so that all physics teachers can contribute to further development.

## Principles

* Working collaboratively will increase the speed resources are made.
* Working collaboratively will increase the quality of resources.
* We're trying to produce **lots** of repeatable tasks for students to practice specific skills. This is not a bank of exam questions.
* All variations should be contributed back to the community.

## Limitations

* I'm a self-taught amateur developer! My code is not clean or efficient but sometimes gets the job done. Comments for improvements are welcome.

## Future goals

- [X] Consistent design across all resources. Latex template?
- [ ] Complete all areas of the GCSE
- [ ] Complete all areas of the A-Level
- [ ] Build a community of contributors both authoring and using Github issues
- [ ] Expand beyond worksheets to textbook pages


## Getting Started

1.  Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
2.  Download or clone the project from github (top right of this page)
3.  Open the project by double clicking on OpenPhysics.Rproj
4.  Open the .Rmd you are interested in
5.  Click 'Knit' in the markdown window to produce a pdf version of the worksheet.
